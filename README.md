# who-is-flooder
A small application that floods an IP network with BACnet "who-Is" messages. Useful for stress testing BACnet controllers.

I developed this application to stress test BACnet controllers. The idea is to flood the network with who-Is messages that the
controller would be forced to process and respond to.
